# dmenu_schuam

This is my patched version of [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/). I
cloned the origianl git repo with

``` git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu ```

and than patched it with some patches found
[here](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/).

The content of the original README file can be found below.
